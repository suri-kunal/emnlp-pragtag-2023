            "Third, even if ectopic ANP were the primary cause of hyponatremia, ADH levels would still be expected to be elevated secondarily because hypovolemia resulting from ANP-induced sodium wasting should stimulate ADH secretion from the posterior pituitary; i.e. ADH is inappropriately high, but not ectopically secreted.
