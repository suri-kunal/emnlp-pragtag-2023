            "Clearly research communities and resources need to lead from different angles - but nevertheless in a more rapid and expansive publishing mode, new mechanisms will be required to ensure rigour, and support the desired behaviour around data deposition and archiving. ",

            "Therefore an open science platform for articles will need to operate in a well-coordinated fashion with data archives and processes to ensure that the gains in article publishing also apply to related data and other research objects (and the emerging credit systems for those too).",

            "For many researchers, deeply engaged in their work at the bench, such open science systems are a long way from current operating practices, so adoption may take a while and many incentives along the way required."
