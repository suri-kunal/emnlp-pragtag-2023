            "The economic impact, research priorities and research constraints are very different in veterinary compared with medical babesiosis. ",
            "In fact it is possible to argue that even the parasites are different, since the vast majority of human cases are caused by a parasite ( Babesia microti ) that is only distantly related to those prevalent in veterinary babesiosis ( Babesia sensu stricto), and there are differences in their biology such as presence or absence of transovarial transmission, sensitivity to antibabesials, availability of in vitro cultures etc.",

            "The authors have identified some research areas that require more attention, for example blood transfusion infection in the USA, development of vaccines (presumably molecular), development of new antibabesials, but have not provided the necessary context or evidence for these conclusions.",
            "Some important issues that the authors seem to have ignored completely, include the development and successful use of live vaccines for cattle babesiosis over a long period of time, the prodigious, but failed efforts, to produce molecular vaccines against cattle babesiosis (which indicates the very great difficulty involved in the development of vaccines for human use), the change in direction and emphasis of babesiosis research in general with the discovery of B. microti in the US, and epidemiological issues such as the extension of the geographical range of infections, although briefly touched on in relation to the UK, for reasons that are not clear.",
            "The references make little mention of established authorities in the topic and there are at least five instances of self-citation. ",
            "Finally there are many examples of poor sentence construction (e.g. the last part of the last sentence in the abstract, inaccurate statements (e.g. the first sentence in the Introduction and the first sentence in the second paragraph), unnecessary sentences (e.g. the third sentence in the second paragraph) etc. ",
